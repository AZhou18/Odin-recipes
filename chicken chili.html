        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>I love a hearty beef chili as much as the next guy, but once in a while there's nothing wrong with going over to the light side and enjoying an equally comforting bowl of white bean and chicken chili.</em></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 boneless chicken</li>
            <li>1 large onion</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts and cook until browned, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, flip breasts, cover the pan, and cook until browned on the other side, about 5 minutes. Remove to a plate and allow to cool before chopping into cubes.</li>
            <li>Return skillet to medium heat, add 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, onion, salt, and black pepper. Cook and stir until onion turns translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir ancho chili powder, cumin, flour, chipotle pepper powder, and oregano into the onion mixture; cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 cup of the chicken broth and stir, scraping up any brown bits off the bottom of the pan. Stir in cornmeal and bring to a simmer.</li>
        </ol>
